# csharpier-vscode

CSharpier formatter for Visual Studio Code.
To learn more about CSharpier go to [CSharpier Github](https://github.com/belav/csharpier)

I am not the author of CSharpier, but since I am a big fan of the way CSharpier formats files I decided to make this extension so that it can be easily integrated into the best editor out there.

If you discover any issues when using this plugin please open an issue on Github.

## Features

Formats C# files, can be used as a "format on save" formatter for convenience.

## Requirements

You must have CSharpier installed on your local system for this extension to work, please go to [CSharpier Github](https://github.com/belav/csharpier) for instructions on how to install it.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `csharpier.debugLog`: enable/disable debug logging.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

First release, hello world!


## TODO

Feel free to make a PR to anything in this list.

* Improve error message when CSharpier is not installed. Would be more nice if the extension can just run the install command instead of just linking to CSharpiers Github.
